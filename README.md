# Sarcophagus

Similar to [boom](https://github.com/holman/boom), except that it:

* is written in 165 lines of MoonScript (which compiles to Lua source code), in a single file
* does not (yet) use multiple storage backends, for now only a single file containing a [tnetstrings](http://tnetstrings.org) dictionary
